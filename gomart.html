            <h3 class='ptitle'>Project Goal.</h3>
            <p> The goal of the project was to elevate a preliminary web application that offers valuable insights into enhancing 
                profit margins through a comprehensive understanding of profitability at SKU levels 
                (a unique number used to identify and track products).In addition, the platform facilitates centralized 
                organization for tracking and managing multiple storefronts efficiently.

            <h3 class='ptitle'>Challenge</h3>
            <p>The initial application which encapsulated the fundamnetal components of the product itself, was quite overwhelming.
                This was as a result of the nature of the substantial data involved. The client acknowledged the need to streamline processes 
                and enhance user experience. 
            </p>

            <h3 class='ptitle'>Solutions</h3>
            <p> The UX team aimed to improve the existing product by applying UX best practices to effectively structure
                 extensive data sets. Through modifications in typography, implementation of visual hierarchy, and 
                 incorporation of other UX best practices, the team sought to provide users with the flexibility to navigate
                  and comprehend the potentially overwhelming volume of data more seamlessly.
            </p>

            <h3 class='ptitle'>The Process</h3>
            <p>For ease of understanding,  project was divided into phases with each phase giving more context and supporting
                 the overall completion of the project.</p>

            <h3 class='ptitle'>Discovery</h3>
            <p> The process kicked off with the designers having a meeting to review the details and content supplied by the client. 
                In the course of the meeting, we identified the project's scope, problem, proposed solution, and strategies for
                its effective implementation. Understanding the significant volume of data to be presented, the client 
                 acknowledged the need for an improved user experience. The client's primary emphasis was on ensuring that 
                 users comprehensively understand their profitability at both the order and SKU levels.

                <li class="ptitlesub" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Client Questions</li>
            
            
            <p>In an attempt to grasp the project's scope, the team raised relevant questions aimed at obtaining 
                a more profound understanding of the project. I took an active role in curating some questions for the client
                to help us get a clear understanding of the scope of the project. Some of our findings were:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Certain elements from the initial mock-up were essential to include in the final product</li>
                <li>The client is willing to explore options beyond the current style guide</li>
                <li>Images of the products were not crucial</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Given the designers' unfamiliarity with the industry, the client willingly provided detailed explanations 
                of the page components and their user-centric benefits. This collaborative effort ensured that the team and
                 I possessed the essential information required for the successful execution of the project.
            </p>

            <li class="ptitlesub" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Competitive Analysis</li>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">The team conducted a comprehensive competitive analysis to understand the industry standards. Through this 
                analysis, we examined similar companies already in existence, their strengths and weaknesses, with the aim of 
                identifying potential advantages for
                 GorMart. In the process, we successfully pinpointed the top three competitors.

        </ul>

            <h3 class='ptitle'>Ideate</h3>
            <h5 class="ptitlesub">User Stories</h5>
            <p>The team received user stories from the client, aiming to encompass key components of GorMart and later
                 transforming them into detailed narratives.These narratives formed the groundwork, enabling us to outline
                  our user journey, screen by screen. Here are the specified user stories:</p>

            <div class='textcontainer'>

            </div>

            <p></p>
            
            

            <h5 class="ptitlesub" style="margin-top: 50px;">User Flows</h5>
            <p>After examining the user stories, the team initiated a follow-up meeting to discuss their evaluation. 
                During this evaluation, questions arose, particularly regarding the categorization of users involved in 
                the project (e.g., managers, e-commerce sellers) and the quantity of user types. It became evident that 
                a meeting with the client was imperative to gain a comprehensive understanding of the project's scope. 
                This meeting would enable the team to determine the necessary variations for each user flow.


                I proactively addressed user story 4: As a user, I want to view the product's performance. 
                By crafting user flows, I gained valuable insights into the user's journey toward achieving this goal. 
                My primary aim was to guide the user to their objective in the most efficient manner, minimizing the 
                number of steps required. 
            </p>

            </div>
          

            <h3 class='ptitlesub'>UI Inspiration</h3>
            <p>The team and I curated inspirations to envision the desired overall tone and UI for GorMart. During 
                our collaborative meeting, each team member presented their respective inspirations. Our collective 
                aim was to establish a clean and modern aesthetic, aligning the product with industry standards. 
                This involved incorporating interactive elements to enable user feedback.

                I selected products like Shopify as my sources of inspiration because it not only thrived in the e-commerce 
                industry but also boasted a user base in the millions. Shopify consistently presented a modern and clean
                 appearance, skillfully utilizing space without inundating the user. I believe that it delivered a sufficient 
                 amount of information, focusing solely on what is relevant to the user and their requirements.</p>

                <img src='/images/features.svg' class='pimagekid' style="margin: auto;">
            </div>

            <h3 class='ptitlesub'>Low Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
            <p>Each designer presented their low-fidelity wireframes specific to their designated user flows. 
                This presentation fostered a collaborative environment, enabling the team to openly share insights 
                on what each designer deemed beneficial for both the user experience and the business objectives.

                While developing my low-fidelity wireframes, I concentrated on efficiently utilizing available space. 
                My goal was to present essential key performance indicators (KPIs) in a tidy and organized fashion, 
                with the chart serving as a focal point alongside the KPIs.</p>
            
            <div class='pimage'>

            </div>
            

            <h3 class='ptitlesub'>Medium Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
            <p>In this stage of wireframing, our primary objective was to effectively present data without overwhelming 
                the user. Given the substantial amount of data involved in this product, it was particularly important for the team to 
                implement UX practices to avoid cognitive overload for the end user. Among the key best practices are:

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Implementing a visual hierarchy</li>
                <li>Employing color cues upon clicking a product</li>
                <li>Including only essential information in the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) cards</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We aimed to address business requirements by enhancing user engagement. This involved introducing a 
                diverse set of filters and incorporating additional UI elements, such as dropdowns and sliders.
            </p>

            <h3 class='ptitle'>Design</h3>
            <h3 class='ptitlesub'>UI Iterations</h3>

        <p> The team and I considered the dashboard to be the focal point of the product, prompting us to undertake an 
            iterative process to enhance it. Each designer presented their unique iteration, featuring variations in colors, 
            format, and overall UI.</p>

            <p>I showcased my screen, indicated by the green highlight in the image. In my iteration, my primary focus 
            was to emphasize the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and graphs, as these elements would provide visual 
            assistance to the user in understanding their data. I adhered to the colors specified in the style guide, 
            striking a balance to avoid overwhelming the user with excessive color. Instead, I strategically applied color 
            to enhance user interaction—such as highlighting selected items, color coding product statuses for user 
            notification, and employing typography in various contexts. Additionally, I constructed Key Performance 
            Indicator (KPI) cards for the dashboard. These cards presented crucial information, providing users with
             immediate insights into their standings.</p>
            
            <p>Ultimately, the client selected my iteration, expressing that it aligned more closely with what they 
            were seeking. They appreciated its simplicity, eye-catching design, and directness.</p>

            <h3 class='ptitlesub'>Final Style guide</h3>
            <p>The team and I compiled the definitive style guide, designed to be accessible to all stakeholders, 
                including developers requiring specifications for various elements. The style guide encompassed detailed 
                specifications for the following:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><bold>Typography: </bold> Our team chose Poppins as our font choice because it resonates with the bold 
                aesthetic commonly found in the automotive industry</li>
            </ul>


            <h3 class='ptitlesub'>Prototype</h3>
            <p>I assumed full responsibility and crafted the prototype for the newly redesigned product. Building a 
                prototype offers numerous advantages, including:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Enabling stakeholders to experience a simulated interactive product</li>
                <li>Facilitating user testing to validate the resolution of initial problems and pain points</li>
                <li>Observing the user journey to ensure there are no additional issues faced by users</li>
            </ul>
            
            <img></img>

            <h3 class='ptitle'>Reflection</h3>
            <p> My role at Tromml presented a significant challenge but also a tremendous opportunity for growth as a 
                UX designer. Given my limited familiarity with the automotive industry, I recognized that asking 
                clarifying questions and conducting thorough research would be crucial in the design process based on 
                my past experiences. The initial stages were challenging for the team as we grappled with determining the 
                essential elements from the preliminary product. However, through multiple conversations and a meeting with 
                the client, we successfully identified and pinned down the necessary items for each screen.</p>

                <p>Navigating a project with such a substantial volume of data was initially daunting due to my limited 
                experience in this domain. However, this challenge proved to be immensely instructive, providing me with v
                aluable insights on how to approach similar projects in the future. For this particular project, I 
                discovered that implementing a dashboard and offering users the flexibility to switch between different 
                storefronts was the optimal solution. Yet, I acknowledge that the approach that worked here might not
                 be universally applicable to all data-heavy projects. Looking ahead, I am eager to apply the lessons 
                 learned from this experience and explore diverse methods of presenting data-rich content while adhering to
                  UX best practices.</p>
