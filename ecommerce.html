            <h3 class='ptitle'>Project Goal.</h3>
            <p>The primary goal of this project was to refine the search experience of an online ecommerce book shop through a more intuitive and stremlined filter functionality.
                In addition to this, efforts were put in place to elevate the overall look of the website by adopting modern and more visially appealing
                measures, reduction of cognitive load of users and generally improving the experience of the website. 
            </p>

            <div class='pimage'>
                <img src='/images/firstpicecommerce.png' alt='an image' class="pimagekid">
            </div>

            <h3 class='ptitle'>Background and Problem Discovery</h3>
            <p> This project is based on an outdated ecommerce book shop called Marvin books.  Upon inspection of the website, the existing filtering mechanism on the website were comprised of
                5 dropdowns that only allowed users to filter by one property of a dropdown at a time. 
                This was a major usability issue as users were greatly limited in their freedom 
                and flexibility to explore results as desired.  See below for a better visual understanding
            </p>

            <h5 class="ptitlesub" style="margin-bottom: 30px; margin-top: 30px;">Old Website</h5>
            <div>
                <video width="100%" style="margin-left: -5%;" controls>
                    <source src="/images/oldvideofilter.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    Your browser does not support the video tag.
                </video>
            </div>

            <p>  After selecting a property from a category dropdown, the filter dropdown itself was removed and this led
                 to two further problems 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    1. The inability of the user to select other attributes pertaining to that particular filter dropdown as all its attributes 
                    along with itself was removed. 
                    The only way the user could backtrack was to hit reset which would refresh the whole filter functionality and no matter how far they had 
                    gotten in the search, they would be back to square one.
                </li>

                <li>
                    2. There was no trail of the filters a user had selected. This forced the user to make a mental 
                    note of the filter options they had chosen which consequently led to an increased cognitive load,
                    higher frustration levels and eventual drop off from the website. 
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class='ptitle'>Possible Solutions</h3>
            <p> Following the analysis of the existing usability issues, i arrived at a set of possible solutions </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    1. Firstly,I had to devise a much better layout for the filter mechanism. One that would ensure, scalability, give users the freedom to 
                    be in control of their search and provide a visual trail of filter options that had been selected by them, there by reducing the cognitive load and frustration
                    levels of the users.
                </li>

                <li>
                    1. Futhermore, i had to carry out some research to delve into what users prioritise when filtering for books on the website.
                   By presenting to them what filter options they would most likely be keen to use, this would enable them find their preferred books quickly and more efficiently. 
                </li>

            </ul>

            <h3 class='ptitle'>Research</h3>
            <p> Based on the possible solutions laid out, it was time to gather insights that would serve as the foundation for the redesign

            <ol>
               <li class="ptitlesub" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Interview Insights</li>
            
                <div>
                    <p>I held interview sessions with the users to gain insights into what filter options they prioritise. This is represented diagramatically below </p>
                      
                    <div class="barchart">
                        <img src="/images/barchart1.png" style="width: 100%;"></img>
                    </div>
                   
                    <ul>

                            Genre 
                        </li>
                        <p>
                            With this topping the list at 83%, users commonly appereciate  the abilityy
                            to narrow down thier search based on the specific genres, catering to their varied literacy preferences. 
                        </p>

                        <li class="ptitlesubecom">

                        </li>
                        <p>
                            Following closely behind, a significant portion of users find it crucial to filter books by their favorite authors,
                            streamlining the process of discovering new release from preferred writers
                        </p>

                        <li class="ptitlesubecom">
                            Price range 
                        </li>
                        <p>
                            Its no surprise that budget considerations are important and users value the option to filter books based on their Price
                            range to stay within their spending limits
                        </p>

                        <li class="ptitlesubecom">
                            Ratings and Reviews 
                        </li>
                        <p>
                            From the research, it was discovered that many users rely on filters relating to ratings and Reviews
                            helping them identify well received books and make an informed decision.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The ability to filter by languge allows users to choose books based on their literal fluency. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            lastly, Some users find it helpful to filter books by release date, enabling them to discover new releases or focus 
                            on recently published titles
                        </p>

            </ol>
            <p> In a bid to devise a more intuitive filter functionality and present it in a well structured manner, i analysed a couple of existing  e-commerce websites 
                to know what layout were being used, how these were presented to users as well as their respective strengths and weaknesses
            </p>

            <div>
                <!-- <img src="/images/ebay.png"></img> -->
                <div>

                        Ebay uses a top filtering bar to facilitate product discovery. There are pros and cons to this type of display which i 
                        will cover below
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="prosandcons">Pros</h5>

                    <h5 class="prosandcons">Cons</h5>
                    <ul style ="margin-top :5px;">
                        <li class="list">Ths type of filtering bar is not scalable. If the number of filters were to increase, the top bar would become 
                            cluttered and complex, negatively impacting user experience.
                        </li>

                        <li class="list">
                            Options of the individual filter categories cannot be viewed at a glance, prompting the user to interact with them
                            thereby increasing the number of clicks before they get to their goal. 
                        </li>

                        <li class="list">
                            As filters are fixed at the top of the bar, users may need to stroll back up to the top of the page to access filters which
                            can be inconveneient in lengthy content.  
                        </li>
                    
                    </ul>

                        As expected, this design has its pros and cons as well.
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="prosandcons">Pros</h5>

                        <li class="list">This method of display allows for a hierarchical arrangement of filters, facilitating a more organised and

                        <li class="list">The filters are expandable and run alonge the lenghth of the page. Hence if more filters needed to be added, that could be 
                            easily done design and development wise.
                        </li>  
                    </ul>

                    <h6 class="prosandcons">Cons</h6>

                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>After analysing the pros and cons of each filter design, i opted for the left side filter as the pros outweighted the cons 
                and was more suited to the nature of the ecommerce website i was building.
            </p>

            

            <h3 class='ptitle'>Final Design</h3>
            <p>After completing the previous steps, i proceeded to get some UI inspiration across the web and came up with the final design
                below
            </p>
            <video width="100%" controls style="margin-left: -5%;">
                <source src="/images/finaldesignvid.MP4" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
              </video>

            <h3 class='ptitle'>Where the usability issues resolved?</h3>
            <p>Upon finalizing the design, i took a quick trip down memory lane to review the original usability problems and compare then with 
                the new design
            </p>

            <img src="/images/topandleftsidebar.png" style="width: 100%;" ></img>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
                As seen in the highlighted area, the new design adopts both a top and left side filtering bar. The top bar plays a 
                secondary role as it presents a general overview of the website. The left side bar being 
                the primary filter mechanism and having the feature of being scrollable,
                houses the filtering options users are more keen to adopt in their search based on the research. As against the old design,
                 The properties of each filter option 
               in this new design is laid out visually for the user promptimg them to instinctively selct what property best matches their 
               preference. 
               <p>In addition to that the information is presentred in a way that is not overwhelming to the user with the help of the 
                "see more " feature that hides away some properties. Futher more, users now have the opportunity to select a different 
                property of a filter option without having to refresh the website as was prevalent in the old design.</p>I
            </p>

            <img src="/images/filterresults.png" style="width: 100%;"></img>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">As seen in the highlighted area, the new design provides a visual trail of filter option that had been selected by the user. 
                This re-enforces the users actions and ensures they have full control of the search process. 
            </p>

            <h3 class='ptitle'>Mobile Responsiveness</h3>
            <p> There was no mobile responsiveness for the original design, so i decided to add one as part of the redesign process </p>
            <img src="/images/mobilescreens5.png " style="width: 100%;"></img>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Due to the limited space on mobile screens, i adopted a bottom filter bar. With the bar being fixed at the bottom and visually 
                compelling, it would be hard for users to miss it. Studeis have also shown that users are more likely to click on buttons located
                at the bottom of the mobile screen as it as its within favourble distance from the thumbs.
            </p>

            <h3 class='ptitle'>Conclusion</h3>
            <p> If you have gotten to the conclusion of this case study, i want to say thank you for reading through. The goal of the design
                process was to imporove product discovery through an enhanced filter functionality and i believe that was met in the cousre
            of the design process. Ofcourse with design processes, there is not a definite "end" as it is a continously looping preocess. That being said,
            if the need arises, there would be a second round of usability testing and refinement to the design to continously meet the needs 
        of the users. I would be happy to hear from you if you would like to propose any changes or share your opinions about the design process
     thank you. </p>
