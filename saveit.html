            <h3 class='ptitle'>Project Goal.</h3>
            <p>The goal of undertakig this project was to design an app where financial freedom is granted to as many 
                people as possible through better money management such as strict  savings, passive income and easily 
                accessible investment opportunities.
            </p>

            </div>

            <h3 class='ptitle'>Challenge</h3>
            <p>One of the crucial steps to financial freedom, is through a solid savings plan. It was left to me to find out :  
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>How I can help thousands of people maintain a savings culture</li>
                <li>How to ensure discipline whilst saving</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class='ptitle'>The Process</h3>
            <p> I followed the Human Centered Design process to investigate how to ensure financial freedom through savings and 
                invstements. Using the research synthesis as my guide, I brainedstormed possible solutions and usecases. I then 
                tested via usability tests and developed high fidelity design screens from my findings.

            <h3 class='ptitle'>User Research</h3>
            <p> The design process kicked off with the commmencement of user research. The primary mode of research was 
                via interviews both physical interviews and phone interviews. Together with this, i conducted product analysis
                to see how similar companies in FinTech were acheiving similar aims as mine.
            </p>
            <h3 class='ptitle'>Terget Audience</h3>
            <p>My Target audience were young and middle-aged adults within the ages of 18 - 40 years. Through research, it was made known
                that these individuals often go online via their mobile phones to conduct day to day transactions. Since
                SaveIt is an online plaform, it only makes sense that these set of people make up 70% of my users.

            <h3 class='ptitle'>Interview Questions and Answers</h3>
            <p> I made a list of targeted questions to know the savings situation wit different individuals and how to help them in maintaining a savings culture and 
                ensuring discipline while at it. 
                 interviewed a total of 6 individuals. Below are some of the interviw questions and answers.

            <h3 class='ptitle'>Personas</h3>
            <p>I created two personas based off on the insights gotten from my research. Similar answers were grouped 
                together to form each persona.

            <h3 class='ptitle'>Solution</h3>
            <p>After careful consideration of the outcome of my research, i commenced a couple of brainstorming sessions 
                on my quest for digging uo solutions.</p>
            <p>I came up with three methods to ensure a better user experince in savings</p>
            
            <div class='pimagetwo'>
                <img src='/images/features.svg' class='pimagekid'>

                <h3 class='ptitlesub'>PiggySave</h3>
            </div>
            
            <p>PiggySave helps users build up their savings daily, weekly or monthly depending on their preference. 
                The process involves money being deducted from a viable source of income the user provides. This way,
             users do not have to constantly remind themselves to save, the work is done for them automatically.</p>

            <p> Asides
                from this, users have three days per annum to withdraw funds they have saved. These days are completely set
                by the users to give them control over their finances.</p>

        <p>However, if a user tries to withdraw on a day he/she hasnt previously set, he/she risks loosing interests 
            gathered on the savings. This is put in place to ensure discipline during savings which is one of the goals of this project.

            </div>
            
            <p>From Research, it was gathered that most peolpe like to save towards particular occassions or needs.
                To help them acheive that, i set up TargetSave. 
            </p>

            <p>With automatic deductions, progress bars and upto 00
            % interest rate, users are sure to be on track towards acheiving their targeted needs.The fun part is they can have as many target savings as they like.</p>

                <h3 class='ptitlesub'>LockedFunds</h3>
            </div>
            
            <p>This feature was added to help those users who have a particular sum of money they are not quite sure
                what to do with just yet or are planning on keeping it for an upcoming event. 
            </p>
            <p>The lockedFunds feature helps in locking up funds users dont want to have access to for a particular duration of time. Interest gathered on locked 
                funds depend on the duration of time its being locked
            </p>

                <h3 class='ptitlesub'>Summary</h3>
            </div>
            <p>These three features help in building and maintaining a savings culture with exciting
             financial incentives to back it up. They also ensure discipline as users are likely
              to loose interests gathered if they try to access their savings befoe the due date.</p>

            <p> This is  a visual representation of how the user moves through the app. The focus was making is simple so it feels natural
